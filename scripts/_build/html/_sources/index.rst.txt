   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to G4Conservation documentation!
========================================

This project aims to predict G-quadruplexes (G4) in genes and transcriptomes species.

Data availability
=================

`Archive data`.

.. _Archive: https://usherbrooke-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/vana2406_usherbrooke_ca/ER3abTOB9MlMndFCvbQ0KfgBu74R3R3uP_XJoEoyIWQPCA?e=c3FROY

If the upper link is not working, the snakemake pipeline can be executed.

Here is a global pipeline of how to use those scripts : |H|

.. |H| image:: /picture/dag.png

Prerequisites
-------------

To use all scripts in this project you will need to have python2.7 for G4RNA screener and python3 for the other scripts.

You will also need to install G4RNA Screener from
`Michelle Scott gitlab`_.

.. _Michelle Scott gitlab: http://gitlabscottgroup.med.usherbrooke.ca/J-Michel/g4rna_screener.git

Following is procedure to install G4RNA screener ::

    git clone http://gitlabscottgroup.med.usherbrooke.ca/J-Michel/g4rna_screener.git
    sudo apt install python-pip
    pip install biopython
    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install PyBrain
    pip install regex
    pip install scipy
    cd PATH/TO/PYTHON/dist-packages/    or    cd PATH/TO/PYTHON/site-packages/
    sudo -i
    wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-Python/mysql-connector-python-2.1.4.tar.gz
    tar -xzf mysql-connector-python-2.1.4.tar.gz
    cd mysql-connector-python-2.1.4
    python setup.py install

To install snakemake, do as follow ::

    cd
    mkdir software
    cd software
    wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    exec bash
    conda create --name smake -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake=5.7.0
    conda activate smake

Installing
----------
Except for snakemake and G4RNA screener explained earlier, there is no particular installation because their is only individual home made
scripts. Here is a soft description of them:

* ReplaceInformation.py -> This script aims to create
  junction between exons and also compute the coordinates of introns.
  To do that, this script takes as a file with informations about transcripts.
  This file is avaible in Ensembl and downable with Biomart.
* G4RNA Screener -> used on fasta files with genes and junction.
* all G4Annotation -> filters pG4 and add there location and biotype. Inputs are
  output from G4RNA Screener, the parsed file containing introns coordinates and
  also a file containing transcripts's biotype (available on Ensembl).
* G4Calcul.py -> computes all statistics and enrichment about our pG4.
* Coverage.py -> computes coverage between different data set. Takes as input
  3 data set : pG4, G4RNA G4 and G4 from rG4seq study.
* recurentFunction -> little library of functions that are often used.

Command lines
=============

First step, on a local machine : configuration and data retrival
----------------------------------------------------------------

Go to the folder were you want to make this project or create one. You need
to launch scripts from this folder or you will have to change paths.

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 0

   git clone
   cd 
   snakemake -j 700 --use-conda --immediate-submit --notemp --cluster-config cluster.json --cluster 'python3 slurmSubmit.py {dependencies}' -n 

When the pipeline worked one time, G4RNAscreener might not have been launch on all splitted file, so you need to do it a second time :

.. code-block:: bash
  :linenos:
  :emphasize-lines: 0

   for sp in $(ls data); do rm data/$sp/pG4*; done
   for sp in $(ls data); do rm data/$sp/all*; done
   for sp in $(ls data); dorm -r -f data/$sp/Figu*; done
   sbatch scripts/testNbSpliCSV.sh #this command check if there are split file that did not go through G4RNA screener
   snakemake -j 700 --use-conda --immediate-submit --notemp --cluster-config cluster.json --cluster 'python3 slurmSubmit.py {dependencies}' -n
